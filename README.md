#  KIWI Game - Host Guide
##  Introduction
The KIWI game is a number game where players have to avoid saying numbers containing specific digits, replacing them with "KIWI." This document provides instructions for the host of the game.

## Host Instructions
As the host, your role is to manage the KIWI game. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Set Up the Environment:**

    * Open the KIWI game website on your device. The website is for your reference only; players don't need access to it.

    * If you need to change the forbidden digits, you will have to reload the website with the updated set of digits.
2. **Define Forbidden Digits:** 

    * Before the game begins, decide which digits players should avoid saying. You can choose any combination of digits. For example, you might choose "169" as the forbidden digits.

    * Remember that if you want to update the forbidden digits, you'll need to reload the website.

3. **Start the Game:**

    * Press "Backspace," "Delete," or the "Arrow Down" key to decrement the counter.
    * Press "Enter," "Space," or the "Arrow Up" key to increment the counter.
    * Any other keypress will also increment the counter.
    * You can also use the buttons on the screen
4. **Game Rules:** 

    * Instruct the players that they must say "KIWI" instead of the real number if any of the forbidden digits is in the current number.
    * If they accidentally say the forbidden number, they are eliminated.
    * The game continues until only one player remains as the winner.

5. **Manage the Counter:**

    * You have to increment the number when a player says a number or KIWI.
6. **Eliminations:**

    * Keep track of eliminated players. When a player says the forbidden number, they are out of the game.
7. **Announce the Winner:**

    * Continue the game until only one player remains.
8. **Enjoy the Game:**

    * As the host, have fun and enjoy watching the players try to avoid saying the forbidden digits.

Remember that players don't need access to the website; it's for your reference and control of the game. Enjoy hosting the KIWI game and may the best player win!
